The programs that start with the letter 'A' as the file name were written by me.

These programs are about my thesis "Path optimization when interpolating in Numerical Controls"

Please read "A1_main.m" first

The rest of the programs are from the NURBS-Toolbox(Version-1.4.3) written by Mark Spink in 2000, modified by Daniel Claxton in 2007 and Carlo de Falco in 2009.

These programs are used to generate free-form-surfaces/curves by giving the knots and control points.

PS: This NURBS-Toolbox is online available. There are much more useful tools in it.
