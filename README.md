# Path Optimization in CNC
Author: Yanpeng Mei

Finished on: 20. Okt. 2021

Matlab Version: R2020b

These programs are about my thesis "Path optimization when interpolating in Numerical Controls"

The programs that start with the letter 'A' as the file name were written by me.

Please read "A1_main.m" first

The rest of the programs are from the NURBS-Toolbox(Version-1.4.3) written by Mark Spink in 2000, modified by Daniel Claxton in 2007 and Carlo de Falco in 2009.

This NURBS-Toolbox is used to generate free-form-surfaces/curves by giving their knots and control points.

PS: This NURBS-Toolbox is online available. There are much more useful tools in it.
